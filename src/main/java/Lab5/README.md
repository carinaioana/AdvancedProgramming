Document Management System
Write an application that can manage a catalog of documents. An entry in this catalog might be an article, a book, etc.
A document may be located using a path in the local file system or a link to an external URL. Each document has a unique ID, a name and may have additional tags, which are pairs name-value. Example of tags may be title, author, year, publishingDate, etc.

The main specifications of the application are:


 ## Compulsory

 --------


- [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have at least the following classes: Catalog, Document. Create a class responsible with external operations regarding a catalog.
- [x] Implement the following methods representing commands that will manage the content of the catalog:
- [x] add: adds a new entry into the catalog;
- [x] toString: a textual representation of the catalog;
- [x] save: saves the catalog to an external file using JSON format; you may use Jackson or other library;
- [x] load: loads the catalog from an external file.


## Homework

-----

- [x] Represent the commands using classes instead of methods. Use an interface or an abstract class in order to desribe a generic command.
- [x] Implement the commands load, list, view, report (create the classes AddCommand, ListCommand, etc.).
- [x] list: prints the list of documents on the screen;
- [x] view: opens a document using the native operating system application (see the Desktop class);
- [x] report: creates (and opens) an HTML report representing the content of the catalog.
- [x] Use a template engine such as FreeMarker or Velocity, in order to create the HTML report.
- [x] The application will signal invalid data or the commands that are not valid using custom exceptions.
- [x] The final form of the application will be an executable JAR archive. Identify the generated archive and launch the application from the console, using the JAR.
